# Team-Profile-Generator
This is a Node.js application that accepts user input about the employees on their team from the command line to create an HTML file presenting the team member's data. The user is initially asked about the manager's name, id, email, and office number. They are then prompted to select to add an engineer or an intern to their team, or to finish building the team. The engineer selection will prompt for the engineer's name, id, email, and GitHub username. The intern selection will prompt for the intern's name, id, email, and school. Once they select "finish building your team", an html file is generated in the dist folder that displays the data for each team member on a card, with links to their email and github, if applicable. 

This application also includes jest tests for the functionality of the methods in each of the classes.
